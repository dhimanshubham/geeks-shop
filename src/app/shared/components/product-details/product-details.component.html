                    Laravel. You'll learn by doing, not simply studying. At the end of each step, not only will you
                    have learned a new skill, trick or technique - but you'll have built another feature of your
                    first hand-crafted Laravel application. You'll go beyond the Laravel framework itself as we take
                    a look at some of the skills any professional developer needs, to take your career - or indeed
                    hobby - to the next level.
